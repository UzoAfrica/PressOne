## Steps to Reproduce

1. Open the Todo application
2. Type a todo item (e.g., "Buy groceries")
3. Press Enter key multiple times in rapid succession (within 1 second)
4. Observe the list of todos
5. Delete one of the duplicate entries

**Consistently Reproduces:**
- Multiple identical todos appear in the list
- Deleting one duplicate sometimes removes multiple entries

## Root Cause Hypothesis

The issue stems from two key problems in the Todo component:

1. **ID Generation Logic**
```javascript
id: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000)
```
The current ID generation uses `Date.now() / 1000` floored to the nearest second. This means:
- Multiple todos created within the same second get the same ID
- The ID is not unique for rapid additions
- When deleting by ID, all todos with the same ID are removed

2. **No Duplicate Check**
The component doesn't verify if a todo with the same text/ID already exists before adding it to the list.

## Prevention Strategy

1. **Immediate Fix:**
- Use a truly unique ID generation method:
```javascript
id: Date.now() + Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)
```
or
```javascript
id: crypto.randomUUID()
```

2. **Additional Safeguards:**
- Add debounce to the add todo function (prevent rapid-fire submissions)
- Implement duplicate checking before adding new todos
- Add unit tests specifically for:
  - Unique ID generation
  - Rapid todo addition
  - Duplicate prevention
  - Proper deletion behavior

3. **Monitoring:**
- Add logging for todo operations in production
- Track metrics for duplicate IDs if they occur
- Set up alerts for unusual patterns in todo creation/deletion
